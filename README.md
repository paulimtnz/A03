## GLOSSARY
- **Branch**: it allows you to take the original codebase, create an exact replica of it, make changes, and then submit your changes to be merged into the original code base. 
This way, you can make sure the final code base is always bug-free. Or at least not disastrous.


- **Clone**: it is a git command, which creates a clone/copy of an existing repository into a new directory. It is also used to create remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository. It is the most common command which allows users to obtain a development copy of an existing central repository.


- **Commit**: it is a snapshot of your repo at a specific point in time. Think of your working directory as your “in progress” working area; here, created or modified files are not yet reflected in your Git repo. Changes made to files in your working directly only exist locally on your machine.


- **Fetch**: it downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on.


- **GIT**: it is a free and open source distributed code management and Version control system that is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2. In addition to software version control, Git is used for other applications including configuration management and content management.


- **GitHub**: it is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code.


- **Merge**: it incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch.


- **Merge Conflict**: conflicts happen when you merge branches/forks that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. Often, they arise when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.


- **Push**: the push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.


- **Pull**: this command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.


- **Remote**: is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server.


- **Repository**: a GIT repository allows performing various operations on it to create different versions of a project. These operations include the addition of files, creating new repositories, committing an action, deleting a repository, etc. These modifications will result in the creation of different versions of a project.
